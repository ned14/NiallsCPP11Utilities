Niall's C++ 11 Utilities
========================
(C) 2012-2013 Niall Douglas

<p>Current master branch build and unit tests status on Travis CI: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/ned14/NiallsCPP11Utilities"><img valign="middle" src="https://travis-ci.org/ned14/NiallsCPP11Utilities.png?branch=master"/></a></p>

Herein lies some C++ 11 rewrites of useful stuff from TnFOX (http://www.nedprod.com/TnFOX/).
Thanks to the new features of C++ 11, implementation is now both vastly shorter and
easier. Hence the rewrite!

See enclosed doxygen documentation for what's in here and how to build it.

Enjoy!
