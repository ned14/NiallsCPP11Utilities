Niall's C++ 11 Utilities
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Herein lies some C++ 11 rewrites of useful stuff from TnFOX (http://www.nedprod.com/TnFOX/).
Thanks to the new features of C++ 11, implementation is now both vastly shorter and
easier. Hence the rewrite!

See enclosed doxygen documentation for what's in here.

Enjoy!
